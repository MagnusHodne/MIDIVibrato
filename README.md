# MIDI Vibrato detector
A plug-in for splitting a MIDI LFO signal into a frequency and amplitude component. Designed to be used with a device such as a Genki Wave, where you can send vibrato as a MIDI CC signal. You can use it to control vibrato rate and amplitude as separate parameters in instruments from vendors such as Audio Modeling and Aaron Venture
